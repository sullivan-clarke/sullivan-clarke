### Hi there 👋
My name is Sullivan Clarke and I am currently an undegraduate computer science student at the University of Tennessee Knoxville. I am very interested in all things computer science, especially artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, which are two areas I seek to specialize in during my studies at UTK. I am relatively new to coding but currently working on a few small personal projects that I hope to publish on here soon!! Thanks for stopping by😁😁😁
